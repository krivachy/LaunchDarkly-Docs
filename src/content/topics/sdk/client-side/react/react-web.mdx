<CalloutTitle>The React SDK does not work in React Native projects</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

If you want to add LaunchDarkly to your React Native codebase, use the React Native SDK instead. The React SDK is intended for use in web applications, and the React Native SDK is specifically designed to run in mobile environments. To learn more, read [React Native SDK](/sdk/client-side/react/react-native).

You can use LaunchDarkly in a Gatsby application with our [Gatsby plugin](/sdk/client-side/react/gatsby).

The sample code snippets for this SDK are in JavaScript. To learn more about using TypeScript with the React SDK, read [Importing types](#importing-types) and [Using LaunchDarkly with TypeScript](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/using-launchdarkly-with-typescript/).

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>The React SDK is based on the JavaScript SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The React SDK builds on LaunchDarkly's JavaScript SDK to provide a better integration for use in React applications. As a result, much of the JavaScript SDK functionality is also available for the React SDK to use. For a complete client-side JavaScript SDK reference, read [JavaScript SDK reference](/sdk/client-side/javascript).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="info">
<CalloutTitle>SDK version compatibility</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The LaunchDarkly React SDK is compatible with React version 16.3.0 and higher.

The LaunchDarkly React SDK offers two custom hooks. If you want to use these, then you must use React version 16.8.0 or higher. To learn more, read [Hooks](#hooks).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Getting started

After you complete the [Getting started](/home/getting-started) process, follow these instructions to start using the LaunchDarkly SDK in your React code.

To install the React SDK, you need your LaunchDarkly environment's client-side ID. Your client-side ID is available in the **Projects** tab of your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects) page. Client-side IDs are not secret and you can expose them in your client-side code without risk. Never embed a server-side SDK key into a client-side application.

Install the React SDK using either `npm` or `yarn`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'Installing with npm', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'Installing with yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```bash
npm install launchdarkly-react-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add launchdarkly-react-client-sdk
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After you install the dependency, initialize the React SDK. You can do this in one of two ways:

- Using the `asyncWithLDProvider` function
- Using the `withLDProvider` function

Both rely on React's `Context` API which lets you access your flags from any level of your component hierarchy.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Making feature flags available to this SDK</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

You must make feature flags available to client-side SDKs before the SDK can evaluate those flags. If an SDK tries to evaluate a feature flag that is not available, the user will receive the default value for that flag.

To make a flag available to this SDK, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox during flag creation, or on the flag's **Settings** tab. To make all of a project's flags available to this SDK by default, check the **SDKs using Client-side ID** checkbox in your project [**Settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/projects).

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Initializing using `asyncWithLDProvider`

The `asyncWithLDProvider` function initializes the React SDK and returns a provider which is a React component. It is an async function. It accepts an `AsyncProviderConfig` object which is a subset of the `ProviderConfig` object.

The difference between `AsyncProviderConfig` and `ProviderConfig` is that `AsyncProviderConfig` does not have the `deferInitialization` property, because `asyncWithLDProvider` cannot be deferred. You must initialize `asyncWithLDProvider` at the app entry point prior to rendering to ensure flags and the client are ready at the beginning of the app.

Here's how to initialize `asyncWithLDProvider`:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
import { asyncWithLDProvider } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

(async () => {
  const LDProvider = await asyncWithLDProvider({
    clientSideID: 'your-client-side-id',
    user: {
      "key": "aa0ceb",
      "name": "Grace Hopper",
      "email": "gracehopper@example.com"
    },
    options: { /* ... */ }
  });

  render(
    <LDProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </LDProvider>,
    document.getElementById('reactDiv'),
  );
})();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

After initialization is complete, your flags and the client become available at the start of your React app lifecycle. This ensures your app does not flicker due to flag changes at startup time.

If your app does not yet have the user context when you call `asyncWithLDProvider()`, you can instantiate the `LDClient` and call `identify()` after initialization is complete.

Here's how to identify the user after initialization:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="app"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript: app.js', value: 'app', },
    { label: 'JavaScript: index.js', value: 'index', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="app">

```js
// app.js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useFlags, useLDClient } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

export default function App {
  const flags = useFlags();
  const ldClient = useLDClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    ldClient.identify({ key: 'enter-user-key' });
  }, []);

  return <div>Let your feature flags fly!</div>
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
<CodeTabItem value="index">

```js
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from 'app.js';
import { asyncWithLDProvider } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

const renderApp = async () => {
  const LDProvider = await asyncWithLDProvider({ clientSideID: 'your-client-side-id' });

  ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <LDProvider>
        <App />
      </LDProvider>
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById('root')
  )
}

renderApp();
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

To learn more, read [Identifying and changing users](/sdk/features/identify#react).

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>Rendering may be delayed</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

Because the `asyncWithLDProvider` function is asynchronous, the rendering of your React app is delayed until initialization is completed. This can take up to 200 milliseconds, but often completes sooner. Alternatively, you can use the [`withLDProvider`](#initializing-using-withldprovider) function if you prefer to render your app first and then process flag updates after rendering is complete.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>This function requires React 16.8.0 or later</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

The `asyncWithLDProvider` function uses the Hooks API, which requires React version 16.8.0 or later.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

## Initializing using `withLDProvider`

The `withLDProvider` function initializes the React SDK and wraps your root component in a `Context.Provider`. It accepts a [`ProviderConfig`](#configuring-the-react-sdk) object used to configure the React SDK.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { withLDProvider } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

import App from './App';

const LDProvider = withLDProvider({
  clientSideID: 'your-client-side-id',
  user: {
    "key": "aa0ceb",
    "name": "Grace Hopper",
    "email": "gracehopper@example.com"
  },
  options: { /* ... */ }
})(App);

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
render(<LDProvider />, rootElement);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

Customize your client from the `options` field. To learn more, read the [JavaScript SDK reference](/sdk/features/config#javascript).

The React SDK automatically subscribes to flag change events. This is different from the JavaScript SDK, where customers need to opt in to event listening. To learn more, read [Subscribing to flag changes](/sdk/features/flag-changes#javascript).

In the React SDK, streaming mode is enabled by default. To disable streaming mode, specify a `streaming: false` attribute in your `options` object.

## Using `withLDConsumer`

The return value of `withLDConsumer` is a wrapper function that takes your component and returns a React component injected with `flags` and `ldClient` as props.

Here's how:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
import { withLDConsumer } from 'launchdarkly-react-client-sdk';

const Home = ({ flags, ldClient /*, ...otherProps */ }) => {
  // You can call any of the methods from the JavaScript SDK
  // ldClient.identify({...})

  return flags.devTestFlag ? <div>Flag on</div> : <div>Flag off</div>;
};

export default withLDConsumer()(Home);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Configuring the React SDK

The [`AsyncProviderConfig`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-client-sdk/index.html#asyncwithldprovider) object provides configuration to the `asyncWithLDProvider` function and the [`ProviderConfig`](https://launchdarkly.github.io/react-client-sdk/interfaces/ProviderConfig.html) object provides configuration to the `withLDProvider` function.

The only mandatory property is the client-side ID. All other properties are optional.

These are the properties:

- `clientSideID`: This is your project and environment specific client-side ID. This property is mandatory.
- `user`: A LaunchDarkly [user](/sdk/features/user-config) object. This property is optional unless you are initializing in secure mode, in which case it is mandatory.
- `options`: LaunchDarkly JavaScript SDK initialization [options](/sdk/features/config). This property is optional.
- `reactOptions`: This property is specific to the React SDK. You can use this option to [disable automatic camel casing](#flag-keys) of flag keys when using the React SDK. This property is optional.
- `deferInitialization`: This property allows SDK initialization to be deferred until you define the `user` property.

  `asyncWithLDProvider` does not support `deferInitialization`. You must initialize `asyncWithLDProvider` at the app entry point prior to rendering to ensure flags and the client are ready at the beginning of your app.

  By deferring SDK initialization, you defer all steps which take place as part of SDK initialization, including reading flag values from local storage and sending the SDK's `ready` event.

  The one exception to this rule is that the SDK continues to load bootstrapped flag values as long as the bootstrapped values are provided as a map of flag keys and values. If you indicate that the SDK should bootstrap flags from local storage, this will not happen until the SDK initializes.

- `flags`: If you specify this, the React SDK will only subscribe for updates to these flags. When you don't specify this property, the React SDK subscribes to all flags. This property is optional.

  Specify the `flags` property as a map of flag keys and values. The flag keys must be in their original form as known to LaunchDarkly rather than in their camel-cased form. Each flag's value is passed along to the resulting JavaScript SDK [`variation`](/sdk/features/evaluating) invocation and used as the flag's default value in the case of an error.

The following is an example `ProviderConfig` object including each of the above properties:

<CodeTabs
defaultValue="js"
values={[
  { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
{
  clientSideID: "your-client-side-id",
  user: {
    key: "aa0ceb",
    name: "Grace Hopper",
    email: "gracehopper@example.com"
  },
  options: {
    bootstrap: "localStorage"
  },
  reactOptions: {
    useCamelCaseFlagKeys: false
  },
  deferInitialization: false,
  flags: {
    "my-bool-flag": true,
    "my-int-flag": 5
  }
}
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

## Hooks

The React SDK offers two custom hooks which you can use as an alternative to `withLDConsumer`: `useFlags` and `useLDClient`.

<Callout intent="alert">
<CalloutTitle>These functions require React 16.8.0 or later</CalloutTitle>
<CalloutDescription>

`useFlags` and `useLDClient` use the Hooks API, which requires React version 16.8.0 or later.

</CalloutDescription>
</Callout>

`useFlags` is a custom hook which returns all feature flags. It uses the `useContext` primitive to access the LaunchDarkly context set up by `asyncWithLDProvider` or `withLDProvider`. You still must use the `asyncWithLDProvider` or the `withLDProvider` higher-order component at the root of your application to initialize the React SDK and populate the context with `LDClient` and your flags.

`useLDClient` is the second custom hook which returns the underlying LaunchDarkly JavaScript SDK client object. Like the `useFlags` custom hook, `useLDClient` also uses the `useContext` primitive to access the LaunchDarkly context set up by `asyncWithLDProvider` or `withLDProvider`. You still must use the `asyncWithLDProvider` or the `withLDProvider` higher-order component to initialize the React SDK to use this custom hook.

For an example of how to use a custom hook, read [HooksDemo](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/blob/master/examples/hoc/src/universal/hooksDemo.js).

## Flag keys

LaunchDarkly primarily identifies feature flags by a key which must contain only alphanumeric characters, dots (`.`), underscores (`_`), and dashes (`-`). These keys are used across all of LaunchDarkly's APIs as well as in the SDKs to identify flags.

However, JavaScript and React cannot access keys with a dot notation, so the React SDK automatically changes all flag keys to camel case. A flag with key `dev-flag-test` is accessible as `flags.devFlagTest`.

Automatically changing flag keys to camel case poses some problems:

1. It is possible to induce a key collision if there are multiple LaunchDarkly flag keys which resolve to the same camel-case key. For example, `dev-flag-test` and `dev.flag.test` are unique keys in LaunchDarkly, but the React SDK changes them to the same camel-case key.
2. If a flag key contains three or more capital letters in a row, the SDK automatically converts all letters between the first and last capital letter to lower case. For example, the SDK converts a flag with the key `devQAFlagTest` to `devQaFlagTest`. If you use `devQAFlagTest` with the `useFlags()` hook, the SDK does not find the flag.
3. LaunchDarkly's [code references](/integrations/code-references) tool expects your source code to reference the exact key, not a camel-case equivalent. The tool does not detect keys that were automatically changed to camel-case.
4. Because the camel-case functionality is implemented in the React SDK instead of in the underlying JavaScript SDK, the underlying `client` object and functionality provided by the JavaScript SDK reflect flag keys in their original format. Only React-specific contexts such as your injected props use camel case.

To disable the SDK's automatic camel-case feature, provide `asyncWithLDProvider` or `withLDProvider` with the `reactOptions.useCamelCaseFlagKeys` property as shown in the following example. The SDK supports this in versions 2.13.0 and later of the React SDK.

If you enable the automatic camel-case feature and you want to use LaunchDarkly's code references tool, you can configure [alias](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs/blob/main/docs/ALIASES.md#configuring-aliases) support to find camel-cased flags. To do so, use the value `camelCase` for the alias settings.

Here's how to configure alias:

<CodeTabs
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
  ]
}>
<CodeTabItem value="js">

```js
export default withLDProvider({
  clientSideID: 'your-client-side-id',
  reactOptions: {
    useCamelCaseFlagKeys: false
  }
})(App);
```

</CodeTabItem>
</CodeTabs>

With this configuration option in place, you would now access your `dev-flag-test` flag using bracket notation. For example, `flag['dev-flag-test']`.

## Example app

Run this [example](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/tree/master/examples/hoc) for a fully working single page app with React and react-router. You must enter your `clientSideId` in the [client root app file](https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/blob/master/examples/hoc/src/universal/app.js) and create a flag with key `dev-test-flag` in your flag dashboard before running the example.

## Importing types

In addition to its own bundled types, the React SDK uses types from `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`. If you use Typescript and you need to use `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` types, you can install the `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` package as a dev dependency. You can then import the types you want directly from `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`.

If you are using the React SDK within a React application that uses TypeScript, you may encounter some compiler errors or warnings initially. One solution is to wrap your component in a `withLDProvider` function, and then coerce your component to type `<ComponentType<{}>`. To learn how, read [Using LaunchDarkly with TypeScript](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/using-launchdarkly-with-typescript/).

If you use eslint, the SDK requires that you add `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk` as a dev dependency. Otherwise, eslint will report a `no-extraneous-dependencies` error.
